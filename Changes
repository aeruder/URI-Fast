-Fix missing entries in v0.08's change log (oops)

0.08 2018-03-07
-Fix test dependency version causing cpan tester failures
-Adopted URI::Encode::XS's encoding/decoding strategy
-Reduced heap usage

0.07 2018-03-06
-UTF-8 support
-New methods: query_keys, query_hash, encode, decode
-Many methods rewritten in C/XS to make up for the added cost of UTF-8 support
-Switch tests from using Test2::Bundle::Extended to Test2::V0
-Bugfix: fix some missing test dependencies on restricted smoker setups
-Bugfix: some unit tests were using the uri being tested as the test name,
 triggering errors when the uri included a fragment (hash and newlines are
 invalid in test names)

 Test2::Bundle::Extended

0.04 2018-02-26
-Faster uri_split implemented with Inline::C
-Faster auth parsing implemented with Inline::C
-Faster auth assembly implemented with Inline::C
-Faster query param access by doing a regex for each access rather than parsing
 and storing (who knew?)
-This module no longer has common::sense
-Bugfix: auth params now correctly url-encoded/decoded
-See also that a SEE ALSO section was added to POD

0.03 2018-02-20
